includedFeatures:
  - Have at least one room with windows which is tidy and clean for getting ready photos
  - In the same selected getting ready room, have all items such as invitation, bouquet, accessories, and outfits laid out and ready.
  - Request your makeup artist to come 20 to 30 minutes earlier than the time they propose, as South Asian makeup tends to run late.
  - If you intend on taking photos at home with bridesmaids/groomsmen/immediate family, ensure they are fully dressed and ready at your location at least an hour before departure.
  - If you would like to do a first look with bridesmaids/groomsmen/immediate family it is best they are ready and present at the location before the photography start time.
  - We encourage that once you arrive at the venue, if possible, provide us with 10 to 15 minutes to set up lights and photograph the venue and decor before you enter.
  - We encourage setting aside a minimum of 30 to 45 minutes after the wedding to take post-wedding portraits.
