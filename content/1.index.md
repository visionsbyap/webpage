Hello :) I am a photographer based in Toronto, Canada and have been capturing __Weddings and Events__ since 2008. I have been photographing for over 15 years. (yeah, its been quite a journey!) Not only do my team and I capture weddings in Toronto, but we do also travel internationally. My goal is to bring your Vision (pun-intended) to life when it comes to wedding and event photography, as I strive to capture the day with candid and pure emotions, which allows one to relive the day for years to come. Not only do I take delight in capturing pure love and joy, I enjoy taking the time to better get to know each of my clients so that together we can celebrate and capture your stories.

When I'm not behind the camera or editing away on my laptop, you would find me playing video games, watching movies, trying out new food around the GTA with my wife, or just having fun with my friends! Do not hestitate to say hello the next time you see me, I love meeting new people! :)
